Algorithm for Obesity Pharmacotherapy:
Growler Subtype Pharmacotherapy
Pharmacotherapy treatment includes: metformin, topiramate, zonisamide, and/or a glucagon-like protein 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA).
If a patient is on anticoagulants/blood thinner or on anti-epileptics, topiramate and zonisamide are not to be prescribed.Metformin can be prescribed, but defer to the next highest subtype, and ignore Growler subtype.
Initiate Metformin 500 mg PO BID.
Increase to maximum dose (2000mg/day), as appropriate and tolerated after 2 weeks
Continue as mono or combination therapy with other drugs in this subtype.
Metformin 850 mg ER once daily can be used to help reduce GI side effects if 500mg immediate release tabs are not well tolerated.
Prescribe the following medications alongside metformin, when indicated:
Patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 45 and/or Type 2 Diabetes:
Consider prescribing a GLP-1 RA (e.g. semaglutide) or a GLP-1 RA/GIP combination (e.g. Mounjaro).
Patients with a BMI less than 45:
Consider topiramate, starting at 25mg at bedtime
Increase dose as tolerated every 2 weeks by 25mg, to a maximum of 200 mg/ day
Consider extended release (ER) topiramate if a patient cannot tolerate immediate release (IR) topiramate
If patient still cannot tolerate extended release topiramate (ER), consider zonisamide
Special Considerations:
Metformin: has a black box warning-lactic acidosis. When patients are on concurrent therapy with topiramate or zonisamide, they must be monitored for lactic acid acidosis.
This includes monitoring for lactic acidosis signs and symptoms weekly as a PRO on the Alfie Patient Portal and monthly serum lactic acid level checks by their provider.
Renal/hepatic impairment, concurrent use with topiramate, age greater than 64, recent contrast dye, excessive alcohol use or hypoxic states increase this risk.
If suspected, immediately discontinue metformin and instruct the patient to go to their nearest hospital or call 911.
Research has shown that coadministration of metformin and topiramate for the treatment of obesity has not led to increases in lactic acidosis in patients.
Topiramate:
With long-term use of topiramate, wean medication over several weeks to discontinue.
Ketogenic diet may increase the possibility of acidosis and/or kidney stones in those taking topiramate.
Effective contraception should be used in females of reproductive age (18-50 years) and educated that estrogen-based hormonal contraception efficacy may be impaired and a backup form of birth control should be used.
Pregnancy status needs to be confirmed before initiation and monthly during topiramate administration.
GLP-1 RA
Patients with a history of bariatric surgery may be at a higher risk for dehydration and increased side effects.
Those with gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy (not gastric band) are at an increased risk for pancreatitis.
GLP-1 RA can cause delayed gastric emptying, altering absorption of oral medications.
Shorter duration of treatment (<5 months) is associated with weight regain.


Empath Subtype Pharmacotherapy
Pharmacotherapy treatment includes: Naltrexone/Bupropion combination, Bupropion (monotherapy), and/or Zonisamide/Bupropion combination.

If a patient is on chronic opioid, opiate agonist or partial agonist or acute opioids, benzos, barbiturates and antiseizure meds, concomitant use of MAOIs (within 14 days of d/c) defer to the next highest subtype, and ignore Empath subtype.
Initiate generic naltrexone and bupropion combination therapy:
Week 1:
12.5mg naltrexone PO daily with breakfast (dispense 50mg tabs with instructions to quarter the pill) AND 100mg bupropion PO daily with breakfast.
Week 2:
12.5mg naltrexone PO BID with breakfast and dinner (dispense 50mg tabs with instructions to quarter the pill) AND 100 mg bupropion PO BID with breakfast and dinner.
Week 3 and beyond:
25mg naltrexone PO BID with breakfast and dinner (dispense 50mg tabs with instructions to half the pill) AND 200mg bupropion PO with breakfast and 100mh bupropion PO dinner. (Instruct to take two 100mg tabs in AM, 1 100mg tab inPM).
Administer twice daily doses in the morning and in the evening.
Do not administer the medication with high-fat meals.
See naltrexone/bupropion graphic below:
Contrave, trade name for generic combination of naltrexone/bupropion, may be considered, but this is dependent on the patient’s insurance coverage:
Week 1: Initiate Contrave (8mg/90mg) PO once daily. Increase the medication as tolerated.
Week 2: Initiate Contrave (8mg/90mg) PO BID.
Week 3: Initiate Contrave (8mg/90mg) PO 2 tabs in AM, 1 tab in PM.
Week 4 and beyong: Contrave (8mg/90mg) PO 2 tabs BID (2 tabs morning, 2 tabs evening).
Alternatively, consider monotherapy if a patient is resistant to combo therapy or when indicated:
Initiate bupropion sustained-release monotherapy at 150mg PO daily.
Increase to maximum dose 300 mg as tolerated.
Special Considerations:
If a patient has a score of Growler within 25 percentage points of Empath, Zonisamide and Bupropion can be prescribed instead.
Initiate bupropion as stated above in naltrexone/bupropion combo therapy.
Initiate zonisamide 50 mg PO daily
Increase every two weeks by 50mg/day as tolerated. Maximum dose is 400 mg daily.
Administer zonisamide in the evening.
If a patient cannot tolerate zonisamide, revert to naltrexone.
Bupropion- black box warning: increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in short-term trials in those 24 years old and younger. Monitor closely for depression worsening and for the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this patient population.
Reasonable option for a patient who has obesity and concurrently smokes cigarettes and wishes to quit.
May benefit people with excess caloric consumption from drinking alcohol.
Patients with previous bariatric surgery: carefully evaluate GI status (gastric emptying and small bowel transit), nutritional intake, and behavior habits before administration.
Use with caution in those greater than 65 years of age; may be at a greater risk of drug accumulation during chronic dosing.
Ember Subtype Pharmacotherapy
Pharmacotherapy treatment includes: phentermine.

If patient is on MAOIs, defer to next highest subtype
Initiate Phentermine 18.75 mg PO daily for 14 days. Dispense 7 tabs, zero refills. (dispense 37.5mg tabs with instructions to half the pill).
Increase to 37.5 mg daily after 2-4 weeks, if needed.

Special Considerations:
Phentermine is a Schedule IV narcotic requiring a DEA license to prescribe and should be re-evaluated based on the state mandates.
Florida and Ohio have a maximum 12-week period of phentermine prescriptions at a time.
If a patient is not showing significant changes in Ember PROs (>10%) after 2 weeks, phentermine should be increased, as tolerated.
Avoid late evening administration.
Patients prescribed phentermine will need to have blood pressure and heart rate evaluated weekly to monitor for adverse outcomes.
In patients 60 years and older, continue at initial dosage for 12 weeks before considering an increase in dosage.
Rover Subtype Pharmacotherapy
Pharmacotherapy treatment includes: phentermine/topiramate combination.

If patient is on MAOIs, defer to next highest subtype. If patient is on anticoagulants/blood thinner or on anti-epileptics, topiramate and zonisamide are not to be prescribed, and defer to next highest subtype.
Initiate generic phentermine 18.75mg AND topiramate 25mg PO daily for 14 days.
If a patient’s PROs are not showing significant changes (+/- 10%) or are decreasing, increase the medication dosages as indicated below:
May increase phentermine to 37.5mg PO daily, as tolerated.
May increase topiramate to 100mg daily, as tolerated.
Take topiramate in the evening and phentermine in the morning.

Qsymia, trade name for generic combination of phentermine/topiramate, may be considered, but this is dependent on the patient’s insurance coverage:
Initiate Qsymia (3.75mg/23 mg) POdaily for 14 days.
May increase to Qsymia (7.5mg/46mg) POdaily for 14 days.
Increase to maximum dose of Qsymia (15mg/92mg) PO daily, as tolerated.
This is ER, instruction must be given not to chew, cut or crush medication.
Special Considerations:
Phentermine is a Schedule IV narcotic requiring a DEA license to prescribe and should be re-evaluated based on the state mandates.
Florida and Ohio have a maximum 12-week period of phentermine prescriptions at a time.8
Patients prescribed phentermine will need to have blood pressure and heart rate evaluated weekly to monitor for adverse outcomes.
Reference metformin special considerations with coadministration of metformin and topiramate.
With long-term use of topiramate, wean medication over several weeks to discontinue.
Ketogenic diet may increase the possibility of acidosis and/or kidney stones in those taking topiramate.
Effective contraception should be used in females of reproductive age (18-50 years) and educated that estrogen-based hormonal contraception efficacy may be impaired and a backup form of birth control should be used.
Pregnancy status needs to be confirmed before initiation and monthly during topiramate administration.
If patient is 60 years or older, increase dosage slowly and cautiously after 4 weeks.
Pharmacotherapy Management Protocol
Outcome Measurements
Patients should be losing approximately 0.4% of their BW per week. If after three weeks, the patient has not achieved a 1.2% reduction in BW, providers should consider increasing the indicated subtype medication(s) to the maximum dosage, as tolerated and indicated above, if the patient is not already at this dose. If the patient is at the maximum dosage for their primary subtype medication, the provider should consider adding a secondary anti-obesity medication(s) based on the patient’s next highest subtype(s).
If the provider observes a decline in the PROs related to their primary subtype of > 30% over a two week period, the most recently added medication should be discontinued.
The goal at 6 months (24 weeks) is a 12% BW reduction for the patient.
Medication Management
In alignment with the outcomes, a patient's primary subtype PROs are expected to favorably shift within 2 weeks of initiating medications.
If there is no change in PROs, consider increasing medications on an accelerated schedule, if appropriate and the patient is tolerating the medication well.

The medications for the next highest subtype should be initiated:

If the patient is not losing at least 0.4% of their body weight a week for 4 weeks. At this time, the patient should be initiated on the next highest ranked obesity subtype medication.
If a patient is showing no changes (>10%) in PROs after 4 additional weeks, initiate the next medication subtype.
If a sudden rise in another subtype PROs occurs within 20% of the first subtype, consider adding the other subtype medication(s) to the treatment plan.

The following guidelines should be used to consider changes in medication therapy, based on the patient’s response:
When initiating a new subtype, do not double the dose of any medication.

For example, if a patient is already on topiramate or zonisamide and you’re initiating Rover subtype medication therapy, do not double the dose of topiramate or zonisamide, simply add a titration of phentermine.
Upon adding new medications or changing dosages, the provider should inform the patient of these changes and send relevant written education to them.

If a patient has a negative response on their Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) score (>20% change) over a 2-week period, consider stopping dose escalation and titrating their medication(s) to stabilize/improve their GI side effect signs and/or symptoms.
If a patient has a negative response on their GSRS score ( >20% higher change) over a 2-week period, but has been previously stable for the past 2 months, consider lowering the dosage to the previously tolerated dose.
If a patient who is on metformin with topiramate or zonisimide experiences any symptom escalation on the Lactic Acidosis checklist, discontinue metformin

Subtype-based lifestyle intervention in combination with pharmacotherapy 

Recent research demonstrates the efficacy of combining specific lifestyle interventions with medications to address underlying patient subtypes. These should be recommended and explained by health coaches as an adjunct to the medication(s) prescribed by a provider. Here is the cited source:
